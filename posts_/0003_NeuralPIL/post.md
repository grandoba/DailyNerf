## TL;DR
This work tackles decomposition of a scene into its shape, reflectance and illumination. The key technique is a novel illumination integration network called Neural-PIL that replaces a costly illumination integral operation in the rendering with a simple network query. Neural-PIL is an alternative to spherical Gaussian (SG) or spherical harmonics (SH) light representations. This is way faster and way more accurate. The smooth manifold auto-encoder (SMAE) allows a convergence towards a more plausible solution.
